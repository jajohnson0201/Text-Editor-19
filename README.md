## Description
- This assignment was made to showcase my ability as a developer to create a PWA(Progressive Web Application) that has the ability for user data to be stored locally and also via indexedDB and caching saved results, this app is also able to be installed as a desktop shortcut on the users computer.
- The motivation for this project was it being much more challenging than many of the bootcamp assignments.
- This assignment solves the problem of storing cached data and PWA functionallity 
- I have learned that patience and asking questions are my best friend in coding!
